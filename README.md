The Hacking Project is a great training, where the community is queen. There is a lot going on in Paris, Lyon, Montpellier, Bordeaux and it's hard to know all the gossip. So we will create an application where everyone will be able to add gossip on his schoolmates comrades.

In outline, here are the main features of our web application:

    The home page of the site will show all the gossip that we have in base.
    This homepage will give a link for a form where anyone can add a gossip to the database.
    Each gossip will have a dedicated page.

This ruby app is based on the framework Sinatra. we follow a MVC Model View Controller architecture to organize the app.
